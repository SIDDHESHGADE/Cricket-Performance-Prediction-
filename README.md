Cricket Performance Prediction 🎯🏏

Project Overview
This project analyzes historical cricket data to predict player performance, including strike rate, total runs, and wickets taken by a bowler. The model provides insights that can help in team selection, match strategy, and player evaluation.

Problem Statement
Cricket is a data-driven sport, and predicting player performance based on past matches can be valuable for teams and analysts. The challenge is to develop an ML model that can accurately forecast key performance metrics using structured match data.

Tech Stack & Tools Used

Python (Data Analysis & ML Development)
Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-Learn (ML Models – Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest)
OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler (Feature Engineering)

Key Features
✔️ Preprocessing: Categorical encoding, missing value handling, and scaling

✔️ Feature Engineering: Strike rate calculation, total runs aggregation, and wickets count

✔️ Model Implementation: Ridge & Lasso Regression for predicting total runs, Ridge Classifier for wickets prediction

✔️ Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV for optimal model performance

✔️ Evaluation Metrics: R² score, Mean Squared Error, and Accuracy Score

Challenges & Solutions
🔹 Handling Categorical Data: Used OneHotEncoder to transform non-numeric features
🔹 Imbalanced Dataset: Applied resampling techniques to balance wicket-taking records
🔹 Overfitting Issues: Implemented regularization (Ridge & Lasso) and cross-validation

How to Use?

1️⃣ Clone the repository

2️⃣ Install required dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)

3️⃣ Run the notebook/script to preprocess data and train the models

4️⃣ Test predictions on new match data

Future Improvements

🚀 Deploy model as a web app for real-time cricket analysis
